# Game engine dev tasks to do
- [ ] XML scene file loader
  - [ ] XML format of scene
  - [ ] Serialization/deserialization for various class versions
- [ ] Scene object loader
- [ ] Editor
  - [ ] Multifunctional editor cursor (OpenGL window)
    - [ ] Editor scene game object cursor selection
    - [ ] Editor cursor states
  - [ ] Separate editor window (Swing window)
    - [ ] Event bus
    - [ ] Console log

  - [ ] Chop world scene into squares/partitions and store them in tree (QuadTree/Octree)
- [ ] Graphics API
  - [x] Pass into `render()` system method an abstract `Graphics` object instead of `Window`
  - [ ] Solve a multiple textures problem 
    - When we try to render multiple objects with different textures or single object with several

  - [ ] Different kinds of hardware audio API support
- [ ] Cross-platform-ness
  - [ ] Create Maven profiles
    - [ ] Windows

- [ ] Optimization
  - [ ] Improve system handling performance (expensive iterations on systems/components in map)
- [ ] Logger
  - [ ] Reimplement logger based on standard Java logger interface
  - [ ] Print log info into `PrintWriter` (not `System.out`)
  - [ ] Use `printStackTrace` for printing exception stack traces
